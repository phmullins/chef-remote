Chef Remote allows you to use chef-solo without having to create all of the associated scaffolding that goes along with the tool. Instead, you can simply download this repository, replace the included scripts with your own, an then call the `deploy` script.

## Installation
Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/phmullins/chef/chef-remote.git`

## Usage
1. Replace the demo recipes with your own.
2. Type in `./deploy.sh` to run your Chef scripts.
